        BEFORE YOU START EDITING:

        Most text editors should work, but I'd recommend using either Visual Studio Code or Notepad++. Both of them can be downloaded for free.
        Please don't change any of the other code unless you for certain know what you're doing. It can be easily broken.
        When you're finished, zip up the folder and send it back to me. I'll make any changes needed and upload it to the host.

        REFRESHER ON BASIC TAGS:
        <b>Text</b> : Bold Text
        <i>Text</i> : Italic Text
        <u>Text</u> : Underline Text
        <img src="image link"> : Image

        You don't need to add any links. I will take care of them myself when I recieve the files back from you.
        If you need to, you can add a note for me like this as to what text needs a link.

        HEADER CODE:
        <p class="header1">TEXT</p>

        SUBHEADER CODE:
        <p class="header2">TEXT</p>

        If you want, you can change the color scheme in the included css file. There are instructions inside.

                        <b>Jasper</b> is a citizen of <a href="../places/shmorperville.html">Shmorperville</a>. He is a member of the <a href="../unsorted/legcult.html">Legacykit cult</a>.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">APPEARANCE</p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper has a short layer of white fur, with two mossy green horns and a tail that ends in a point. He has four fingers and dark colored paw pads. Typically, he wears a dark green coat with 2 pockets on the front and buttons in gold, a fishing hat which casts a shadow over his eyes, pants and a pair of boots. He is of slightly above-average height, around 5'10".
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">PERSONALITY</p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper can often come across as stoic or unemotional, but the truth is that he just has a lot of trouble getting his emotions across. He is very stubborn and resistant to change, not being easily swayed or persuaded to do something he doesn't want to do. While Jasper has some intuition that he may be on the wrong side of history, he knows it would be a difficult situation to get out of, considering his origins. He also worries for Ivy and would prefer not to leave him alone. While he has issues, he's trying to get better, and is caring and protective of his close friends, treating them like the family he never had. He tries to make the best out of his situation, even if it isn't much.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">HISTORY</p>
                        <br>
                        While the time and conditions of his creation are unclear, Jasper comes from the Nether. He does not have any biological family, at least that he can remember. He spent the majority of his life there taking care of himself. As Legacykit rules over his homeland with an iron fist, Jasper's loyalty towards him is a result of growing up in a place where that was all he knew.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2">SHMORPERVILLE</p>
                        <br>
                        After meeting Ryan, Jasper escaped the Nether and left to travel the overworld. Eventually, they decided to settle in Shmorperville, building a house together. It was during this time that Jasper met Ivory, recognizing the god he was worshipping as Legacykit. They immediately hit it off, becoming close allies due to their shared ideology.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header1">RELATIONSHIPS</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="header2"><a class="uncolored" href="ryan.html">Ryan</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper's closest friend and housemate. The two met after Ryan had fled to the Nether from <a href="../places/cornflower.html">Cornflower</a> to escape the war. Eventually, they decided to leave the Nether and travel to find a place to settle. They came across what would become Shmorperville, and built a house which they share. Jasper helps Ryan with his bakery business from time to time.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a class="uncolored" href="ivory.html">Ivory</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper considers Ivory a friend and close ally, and worries about him, though he would never say that out loud. He wishes the best for him, in stead of his fears that the best may not be possible. Jasper is also a bit afraid of upsetting him, because he knows how poorly it would turn out for everyone. The two are married purely for tax benefits.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a class="uncolored" href="kit.html">Kit</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper doesn't particularly mind Kit, understanding their important role in their religion. He finds them to be endearing, and helps them out of tight spots when they're out exploring. On a bad day, he could be easily annoyed by them, but he knows better than to do anything rash. Their bouts of lucidity are a bit unsettling to him, just because it's so uncharacteristic of them.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a class="uncolored" href="zoxie.html">Zoxie</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper vaguely knew Zoxie from when she was in the Nether, but had pretty much forgotten about her until settling in Shmorperville. The two are friendly, however Jasper is wary of her experiments, declining her many offers to participate. She's a bit eccentric for him, but generally, they get along pretty well.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a class="uncolored" href="shoe.html">Shoe</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper doesn't really know what to think of Shoe. He doesn't hold any personal malice towards them, however his loyalties make it hard to like them. He doesn't want to cause upset on either side, so he doesn't actively interact with them very much. When Shoe and Ivory get into fights, he often tries to mediate for them, not wanting either of them to be harmed by the other.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a class="uncolored" href="rubv.html">Ruby</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper doesn't know Ruby that well, at least relative to the others. Jasper obliges in responding to her surveys, despite his underlying worry that he may reveal too much. In return, he is curious about her extraterrestrial nature, occasionally asking her about life on other planets. She can be a bit annoying to him when he's in a bad mood, a bit too energetic for him.

                            <li>Jasper has 4 pets; a dog named Sammy, and 3 cats named Garfield, Poptart, and Davey. Sammy and Davey are named after real pets, while Garfield is named after the comic character Garfield, and Poptart is named after Infected's cat from Regretevator. </li>
                            <li>After an incident where he and Ryan's home almost burnt down, Jasper is very afraid of fire, despite growing up in the Nether.</li>
                            <li>Jasper does not have a passport. He is the only Shmorper without one.</li>
