        BEFORE YOU START EDITING:

        DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE WITHOUT ASKING UNLESS IT IS ADDING INFORMATION. It can be easily broken. Please make sure you know what you're doing.
        When you're finished, zip up the folder and send it back to me. I'll make any changes needed and upload it to the host.

        BASIC FORMATTING TAGS:
        <b>Text</b> : Bold Text
        <i>Text</i> : Italic Text
        <u>Text</u> : Underline Text
        <img src="image link"> : Image

        You don't need to add any links. I will take care of them myself when I recieve the files back from you.
        If you need to, you can add a note for me like this as to what text needs a link.

        HEADER CODE:
        <p class="header1">TEXT</p>

        SUBHEADER CODE:
        <p class="header2">TEXT</p>

        There are instructions inside the included CSS file if you wish to make your own color scheme.

                <!--

                <td id="main">
                    
                    <p>
                        This is the main wiki content. It contains information written longform, while the sidebar holds the facts.
                        This paragraph would typically just be very general information. On the Phighting Wiki page for Sword, it reads; Sword is a melee Phighter. He was released on 19 February 2022 with Playtest 1. 
                        <br>
                        For line breaks, use the br tag, like I've just done. Any line breaks you make in the HTML document will not show up without it. For a larger space between paragraphs, use two br tags. Don't worry about making anything too long, the boxes will expand automatically.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">APPEARANCE</p>
                        <br>
                        Describe this character's appearance briefly. It doesn't have to be long or complex, just a short paragraph will do.
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed in massa augue. Fusce pharetra pellentesque tristique. Mauris commodo odio ac sem consequat fringilla ac ut felis. Pellentesque et scelerisque lorem, tincidunt feugiat ante. Vivamus lacinia lectus a quam commodo finibus.

                        <p class="header1">PERSONALITY</p>
                        <br>
                        Now, describe this character's personality briefly. A paragraph will do fine, however it can be as long as you want.
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce egestas at orci sed lobortis. Vivamus vitae lectus justo. Donec sollicitudin, enim ac porttitor auctor, arcu ipsum faucibus turpis, ut molestie dolor sem eget nisi. Quisque fringilla viverra ipsum, vel commodo massa interdum eu.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">HISTORY</p>
                        <br>
                        This can be as long or short as you want. I can always give you the files again later if you want to write more.
                        <br> <br>
                        <p class="header2">SUBHEADER</p>
                        <br>
                        If a major event happened at this point in this character's history, you can denote it like this. If you don't have
                        a use for a subheader, you can delete it. If you need to add it back, you can find it in the comments near the top of this document.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">RELATIONSHIPS</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="header2">SUBHEADER</p>
                        <br>
                        Describe any important relationships with other characters here. Use the subheader to denote a character's name.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2">SUBHEADER 2</p>
                        <br>
                        It looks best with two line breaks like this.
                        <br><br>
