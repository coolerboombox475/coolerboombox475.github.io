        I want you to imagine an HTML page with nothing on it. It's blank. But you press CTRL+SHIFT+I. You see something. There's a thing in the place where there's supposed to be no thing. Nothing. There's a thing in the nothing. That thing is me talking to you right now. Maybe I'm not the only thing in the nothing, even. If you think about it, there's never really nothing. By being in the nothing, it is no longer nothing. Because you are a thing. The thing in the no thing. Nothing is a social construct. Wrap your head around that one. Wasn't this page supposed to be about Beast Mode SLingshot? I wonder why it connects here.
