        BEFORE YOU START EDITING:

        Most text editors should work, but I'd recommend using either Visual Studio Code or Notepad++. Both of them can be downloaded for free.
        Please don't change any of the other code unless you for certain know what you're doing. It can be easily broken.
        When you're finished, zip up the folder and send it back to me. I'll make any changes needed and upload it to the host.

        REFRESHER ON BASIC TAGS:
        <b>Text</b> : Bold Text
        <i>Text</i> : Italic Text
        <u>Text</u> : Underline Text
        <img src="image link"> : Image

        You don't need to add any links. I will take care of them myself when I recieve the files back from you.
        If you need to, you can add a note for me like this as to what text needs a link.

        HEADER CODE:
        <p class="header1">TEXT</p>

        SUBHEADER CODE:
        <p class="header2">TEXT</p>

        If you want, you can change the color scheme in the included css file. There are instructions inside.
