                        Jasper is a resident of Shmorperville. He is apart of the <a href="../legcult.html">Legacykit cult</a>.
                        <br> <br>

                        <p class="header1">APPEARANCE</p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper is a humanoid creature with short white fur. He has a moss-green tail that ends in a point, and green horns with small spikes protruding from them. He wears a dark green fishing coat and hat, dark green pants and green boots. The buttons and zippers on his coat are gold. When his hat is on, his face is partially obscured with a shadow. On his left shoulder, there is a tattoo of a Legacykit crystal, however it is normally not shown as it is under his coat.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">PERSONALITY</p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper is rather quiet and mellow, unlike his cult affiliates. He doesn't often get angry, unless he's having a really bad day, but could potentially snap if you pushed his buttons enough. He doesn't outwardly show alot of emotion, not for any serious reason, it's just how he is. <br> Despite his lack of expression, he's not some emotionless jerk; Jasper genuinely cares for his co-workers, even though Ivy doesn't seem to care much in return, or at least doesn't show it.
                        <br>
                        He is quite adamant about alot of things, and can be very stubborn, as change is hard for him. Despite his cult relations, he has some self-awareness that he may be on the wrong side, but continues in stead of his reservations, as he doesn't really know where else to go and worries for Ivory's well-being without him being there.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">HISTORY</p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper was born in the Nether, surrounded by people who worshipped Legkit. Their beliefs quickly rubbed off on him, and it would become a cornerstone of his life as he grew up. He picked up a passion for fishing, and started selling fish to make money. In his early 20s, he decided he wanted to see the world outside his home, and left to travel and find a place to settle.
                        <br> <br>
                        <p class="header2">SHMORPERVILLE</p>
                        <br>
                        Eventually while traveling, Jasper came across the town of Shmorperville, and decided to settle there. He met Ivory after recognizing his religious practice towards Legacykit. The two of them hit it off and became working partners, forming their own 'religious organization' centered around Legacykit.
                        <br>
                        Currently, he lives in a house that he shares with Ryan.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">RELATIONSHIPS</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="header2"><a href="ivory.html">IVORY</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper considers Ivory a close friend, even if Ivory only admits that he tolerates him. He genuinely cares for and worries about him, wishing the best for him in stead of his fears that the best may be impossible. He usually does whatever Ivy asks, not wishing to upset him knowing how poorly it would turn out for everyone. Jasper acknowledges Ivory's problems and often feels like he's the one keeping him grounded. The two are legally married, however it is purely for tax benefits.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a href="kit.html">KIT</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper finds Kit to be endearing, and understands their importance in their religious organization. He often helps them out of tight spots when they're out exploring. He enjoys building things with them and often lets them follow him around. On a particularly bad day, he could potentially find them annoying, but knows better than to do anything rash. He finds their bouts of lucidity a bit unsettling, just because it's so uncharacteristic.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a href="zoxie.html">ZOXIE</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Jasper is on good terms with Zoxie for the most part, but doesn't wish to participate in her experiments. He vaguely knew her from his time in the Nether, but they never really interacted before he moved to Shmorperville. He is a bit put off by her, due to her strange experiments and her infatuation with Legacykit.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header2"><a href="ryan.html">RYAN</a></p>
                        <br>
                        Ryan is Jasper's housemate and friend.
