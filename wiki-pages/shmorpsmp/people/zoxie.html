        BEFORE YOU START EDITING:

        Most text editors should work, but I'd recommend using either Visual Studio Code or Notepad++. Both of them can be downloaded for free.
        Please don't change any of the other code unless you for certain know what you're doing. It can be easily broken.
        When you're finished, zip up the folder and send it back to me. I'll make any changes needed and upload it to the host.

        REFRESHER ON BASIC TAGS:
        <b>Text</b> : Bold Text
        <i>Text</i> : Italic Text
        <u>Text</u> : Underline Text
        <img src="image link"> : Image

        You don't need to add any links. I will take care of them myself when I recieve the files back from you.
        If you need to, you can add a note for me like this as to what text needs a link.

        HEADER CODE:
        <p class="header1">TEXT</p>

        SUBHEADER CODE:
        <p class="header2">TEXT</p>

        If you want, you can change the color scheme in the included css file. There are instructions inside.

                        <b>Zoxie</b> is a citizen of <a href="https://picklezone.neocities.org/wiki-pages/shmorpsmp/places/shmorperville.html">Shmorperville</a>. She is a bionuclear scientist who loves to experiment on anyone and anything. She's infamous for her experiments and is often seen as weird or off-putting by the other citizens, but that doesn't bother her.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="header1">APPEARANCE</p>
                        <br>
                        Zoxie's fur is entirely white, and her horns are light blue. The light blue on her horns matches the blue on her attire. Her lab coat is mainly white.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">PERSONALITY</p>
                        <br>
                        Zoxie could be best described as nefarious. She's known for the various experiments she advertises to other residents, which only a few accept participating in. Various citizens feel as if she is hiding something, or that there's more to her than meets the eye. In the past, she used to be very paranoid, but she's gotten better at dealing with it. That doesn't mean it's entirely gone, though, and she's still hesitant to confide in others when <i>they</i> ask her for favors.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">HISTORY</p>
                        <br>
                        Zoxie used to work in a laboratory as a bionuclear scientist. Eventually, she started being irationally suspicious of her co-workers and as a result started to intentionally make mishaps. The mishaps gradually became more and more serious, until one day, she caused an accident so catastrophic she was fired. No one except Zoxie and her old co-workers know what the accident was. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <p class="header2">POST-ACCIDENT</p>
                        <br>
                        After the accident, Zoxie moved out of the city she lived in as she didn't have the funds to continue living there, and moved to Shmorperville. She still resides there to this day. Even after causing such a big accident, Zoxie is still spiteful and continues to use her knowledge for nefarious things. She is known for her experiments, almost all of which are deadly to participate in.
                        <br><br>

                        <p class="header1">RELATIONSHIPS</p>
                        <br>
                        <a href="legkit.html"><p class="header2">LEGACYKIT</p></a>
                        <br>
                        Zoxie has a sort of celebrity crush on Legacykit. Even though she's neutral, she does believe Legacykit's existence and believes they'd be the perfect couple.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="ruby.html"><p class="header2">RUBY</p></a>
                        <br>
                        Ruby is Zoxie's best friend and scientist buddy. Often times they do experiments together and talk about the results with one another. They also play Touhou together a lot.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="kit.html"><p class="header2">KIT</p></a>
                        <br>
                        Kit is Zoxie's favorite experiment subject. They're immune to radiation and all kinds of poisoning which means they're perfect for experiments that'd otherwise be deadly. Zoxie finds Kit a bit endearing, especially their lack of knowledge about science and the questions they ask her whenever they're in the lab. 
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="jasper.html"><p class="header2">JASPER</p></a>
                        <br>
                        Zoxie knows a bit about Jasper from the very little time she spent in the Nether. Otherwise, she's on good terms with him, but dislikes how he never seems to want to take part in her experiments.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="ivory.html"><p class="header2">IVORY</p></a>
                        <br>
                        Similiar to Boombox, Zoxie's on good terms with Ivory. Ivory, like Boombox, also refuses to take part in her experiments, much to Zoxie's dismay.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="ryan.html"><p class="header2">RYAN</p></a>
                        <br>
                        Zoxie doesn't interact with Ryan a lot, but from the interactions she's had, she doesn't see anything wrong with him.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="shoe.html"><p class="header2">SHOE</p></a>
                        <br>
                        Zoxie finds Shoe suspicious as she doesn't understand why one would be so obsessed with trains and transportation. Isn't Shmorperville the perfect home? Why would someone be so obsessed with the idea of going away from it? There <i>must</i> be something they're hiding.
                        <br><br>
